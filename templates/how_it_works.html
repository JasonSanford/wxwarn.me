        <h3>Get Google Latitude</h3>
        <p>Latitude is an opt-in location sharing service from Google. An app is <a href="https://itunes.apple.com/us/app/google-latitude/id306586497?mt=8">available for iOS</a> and Android has Latitude integrated in with the Google Maps app. Both of these apps automatically track your location and store it securely on Google&apos;s servers.</p>

        <h3>Sign Up for WxWarnMe</h3>
        <p>You sign up and log into WxWarnMe with your Google account. When signing up, Google will ask for your permission to allow our app to view:</p>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>"View basic information about your account"</strong> - Your name, timezone, etc.</li>
            <li><strong>"Manage your best-available location and location history"</strong> - We&apos;ll need access to your location to check for weather alerts near you at any given time.</li>
            <li><strong>"View your email address"</strong> - So we can notify you of alerts and stay in touch. Spam is lame. We won&apos;t do that.</li>
            <li><strong>"Perform these operations when I'm not using the application"</strong> - To keep you informed of severe weather, we&apos;ll need access to your location at all times, not just when you&apos;re on our site.</li>

        <h3>Stay Informed</h3>
        <p>We constantly track weather alerts from the National Weather Service and compare those with your current location. If we find a weather alert near you we&apos;ll notify you via email or SMS (or both). Your message will provide valuable information about the weather alert like the severity of the event and when the alert expires. You can even view an interactive map showing the extent of the weather alert relative to the location we tracked you.</p>
